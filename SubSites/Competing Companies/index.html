    <h1>Computer Hardware Competing Companies</h1>

    <p style="color: gray; font-size: initial;">Note to my teacher: <br> Sorry this took so long... getting the CSS columns to behave right was a little confusing. Turns out, I put them in a container, when I needed them to be in a "fluid container" instead! (see the difference at the bottom of the page)</p>
    
    <div id="maintainer" class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row row-space">
            <div style="border-color: darkred;" class="col-md-4">
                <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);  -webkit-text-stroke: 2px darkred;">AMD GPUs</h1>
                <ul class="pos">
                    <li>Affordability</li>
                    <p class="point">- Most AMD Hardware is much cheaper than the NVIDIA Alternatives</p>
                    <li>Open-Source Drivers</li>
                    <p class="point">- AMD's drivers are open source, leading to better support, security, performance, and more updates, due to community patches and additions.</p>
                    <p class="point">- <b>This also allows some users too create their own versions of the driver, for potentially problematic hardware that AMD may not support any longer.</b></p>
                </ul>
                <ul class="neg">
                    <li>Often behind</li>
                    <p class="point">- Nvidia is much more focused on having the most powerful hardware compared too AMD, so if you need the best graphics card in the world you wont find it here.</p>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="border-color: blue;">
                <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 225, 255);  -webkit-text-stroke: 2px blue;">Intel GPUs</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">WARNING: Intel Dedicated GPUs are extremely new, and currently alot about them is unknown!</p>
                <ul class="pos">
                    <li>Inbetween</li>
                    <p class="point">- Intel seems to have a combination of problems & benefits between the two, for example they are <em>kind of</em> affordable, and <em>decently</em> powerful</p>
                    <li>Linux</li>
                    <p class="point">Many benchmarks for <em>Windows games</em> on the new Intel Arc GPUs seem to often do better on Linux than their Windows counterparts.</p>
                </ul>
                <ul class="neg">
                    <li>Background</li>
                    <p class="point">Intel GPUs do not have a good history, for Intel has always made CPUs, not GPUs, and some of their new performance benchmarks are... questionable due to their drivers.</p>
                </ul>
        </div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="border-color: green;">

                <ul class="pos">
                    <li>More powerful hardware</li>
                    <p class="point">- NVIDIA almost always has more powerful hardware, being able to run most games at higher resolutions at ease.</p>
                    <li>NVIDIA APIs</li>
                    <p class="point">- NVIDIA comes with many tools exclusive to their hardware.</p>
                </ul>
                <ul class="neg">
                    <li>Proprietary Software</li>
                    <p class="point">- Most NVIDIA software is proprietary. This means that for Operating Systems like Linux, new useful tools like Wayland are almost completely innaccessible to NVIDIA Users, without some luck and sweat atleast.</p>
                    <li>Expensive</li>
                    <p class="point">- NVIDIA hardware, especially newer ones, are extremely expensive.</p>

            Container (im a button)
        </button>

        <h1>Explanation to the problem:</h1>

        <p>Containers are designed to hold columns, but the container only takes up ~= 80% of the web page's width. :(</p>

        <p>An alternative to the Container, is the Fluid Container, which takes up the whole web page! (Or, whatever you specify)</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I also learnt the difference between column types!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.25em">To made a column you add a class to an object. col-__-6 is half of the webpage for example. <br>"BUT WHAT GOES IN THE BLANK?!?!" I  hear your cries, and i have figured it out!</p>
        <ul class="smol">
            <li>A col-sm stands for "Column Small", meaning that it will stack the columns on "small" devices</li>
            <li>col-md stacks on medium devices</li>
            <li>And col-lg stacks on LARGE devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="color: red; font-size: 2em">I'm too tired to implement a button to show you that right now though. :(</h1>
