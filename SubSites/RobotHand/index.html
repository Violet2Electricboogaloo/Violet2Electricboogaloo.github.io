        <h1>The problem with creating a Human-like robot Hand.</h1>

        <p>As of today, we are made up of a very complicated structure<br>
            The human hand of course, abides by this, by being one of the most complex parts of the human body.<br>
            It may look simple at first sight, but try your <em>hand</em> at making a robot hand! You will soon find
            there, although a few problems, is one major problem in particular.</p>
        <h1>The thumb!</h1>
        <p>If you have ever truly tried to make a "robot thumb" of sorts, you'll find that its one of the most bizzare
            parts of the hand.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1>Well why is that a problem exactly?</h1>
            <p>Find any sort of ball or cylindrical object, and try to pick it up without the use of the thumb.
                you will almost immedietly find, that it is much more difficult!</p>
