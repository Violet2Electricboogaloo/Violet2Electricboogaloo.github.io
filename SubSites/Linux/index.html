      <p>Gentoo Linux is a linux distrobution that takes the idea of Arch to the next level. The system is installed from almost scratch, with little to no simple alternatives to the installation. The fastest installation of Gentoo was around 20 minutes, with someone who has spent too much time on Linux for their own good. The main idea of Gentoo Linux, is that when installing software, you do not just take some pre-compiled code and use it. This distrobution is only for those extremely patient, willing to wait for compiles and modify software. <a href="https://gentoo.org">Gentoo (and its massive installation guide) can be found here</a></p>

      <p> Arch linux is a linux distrobution based around the idea of editing and modifying the entire system to be to your liking. The limits of arch are few and far between, and there is almost always a work around for the smarter users. The Arch linux system is commonly known to be used amongst more tech-capable people, for its extreme complexity, and fragility to the uncareful mind. This distrobution is the choice of my own, for its easy, small, quick setup, and I use btrfs on the filesystem for simple compression.<a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux can be found here</a></p>

      <p>Debian Linux is a multipurpose simple Linux system. Most versions of Linux are based upon Debian for its simple package manager and simple installation process. Debian can be picked up and used by anyone, being an open source project, it is the root of most Linux Distrobutions. Debian Linux uses the "apt" package manager, a simple starter package manager that a grandma could learn in a few weeks, using simple commands as "apt search" to search for software within custom repositories and "apt install" to install software. <a href="https://debian.org">Debian can be found here</a></p>

      <p>Linux Mint is a debian-based beginner Linux distrobution that comes with alot of free software and little choice so that although the base install is alot more limited than others itself it is extremely simple and does not cause over choice or stress within the end users. Linux mint is based on Ubuntu, another Debian-based distrobution, although the project is working on a new version, completely disattached from Ubuntu, due to past shady software and because they will soon stop updating Ubuntu. <a href="https://linuxmint.com">Linux mint can be found here</a></p>

  <p>I'm not too into cars, sadly, so heres something I actually know/care about. For the record though, I probably wont drive a car, if I do its gonna be a hand me down, if I buy me own it'd probably be a Chrysler Pacifica (39k --> 55k)</p>
