                <h1>Why a Utopia <em>isn't really</em> to everyone's benefit.<hr></h1>
                <p>We live in a world where we do not just get things because we wanted them. Everything we want or need has to be worked for, even if the person getting it isnt the one who was working for it. The idea of a perfect Utopia is corrupt, because for everything to be perfect, someone else has to be working for them perfectly. If we managed to create a utopia, there will almost always be someone underneath doing their hardest and best job to make it work. In the most likely scenario, since the higher ups of the world would not want to do it themselves, they will likely <em>force</em>to do it for them. In the book Scythe, this is shown by the thunderhead and the scythes. For their life to be perfect, somebody has to manage life <em>and</em> their death. The job of handling life goes into the hands of the thunderhead, but since the humans believe that only humans would be able to decide who and how people should be killed to prevent overpopulation, that goes into the hands of scythes. In this fake utopia, the Scythes are truly experiencing a dystopia, with no humane way to solve it.</p>

                <h1>What sacrifices are made to live forever?<hr></h1>
                <p>The mind was never made to live for thousands of years, it was always made for smaller amounts. Although our life spans and our time on this earth has increased slowly, it has given us time to evolve and adapt. The sudden jolt to near perfect immortality comes with the drawbacks of the human mind. If nobody can die, and life never concludes, eventually life will get dull and repetitive. Seeing hundreds of thousands of years go by slowly can drive someone insane with no way to get out easily. <br> The aspect of Over Population also becomes an issue, because humanity needs recourses, and when humanity needs them they take them from nature, and give nature time to regrow, but as more and more people come into existance, there is not enough of those recourses from nature and no way to make them ourselves. Eventually, someone has to be killed, to help the ones who come after them. In the book Scythe, although we fail to get true representation of problems that couild potentially arise from immortality, we do get shown the sad solution for such a world. Their solution to overpopulation is killing off the ones they deem fit for death, but lots feel that with the ability of immortality that it is unfair. Within the age of mortality people would almost always know their moments before death, and also certain things such as murder feel unfair, things such as disease give you time before your death. When it comes to scythes, society, no matter the method, will never see it as reducing the population to prevent overpopulation, but always as just murder.</p>

                <h1>Should Scythes atone for the lives they may glean?<hr></h1>
                <p>All Scythes should be required to atone. Going to the funeral of those gleaned, and respecting those gleaned, should be a part of being a scythe. Refusing to think about the lives you have taken away as if it never happened is not what the Scythes were made to do and shouldnt be allowed.</p>

                <h1>Do we end up losing originiality in the pursuit of equality for all?<hr></h1>
                <p>We do not. What defines originality is ones creativity, what they can make, their personality. If everyone has the same job and the same life span, etcetera, that does not make them unoriginal. They can still be an artist different from everyone else in the world, even if some of the things they do are the same as what everyone else sometimes does.</p>

                <h1>What are the benefits and drawbacks of a society ran by AI?<hr></h1>
                <p>As much as we can try to, an AI will never be exactly like a human. Its important that certain tasks be handled by the humans instead of the AI to keep the world from becoming dull. A world ran by AI could run into problems, such as power and recourses, its important that we make sure the AI is able to get everything it needs, because if something were to happen to the AI, the whole world would go into chaos. In Scythe, this is shown with the Scythes themselves. The reason they exist is not because the Thunderhead wantede them to, but because the humans believed the life and death of society shouldn't be handled by an AI, but by human morals instead. This goes so far as to even the Thunderhead itself agreeing that the decision was proper.</p>

                <h1>How does Citra evolve throughout Scythe?<hr></h1>
                <p>Citra Terranova in the story started out not liking scythes. She and most others believed that they were cruel and unfair. When she met Scythe Faraday, she obtains a new perspective about scythes, and slowly begins to understand they are not terrible people, but trying to help the world. Eventually in the book, she herself becomes a Scythe too, showing that she began to understand the need for Scythes in the world. Eventually she is barely Citra Terranova anymore, but becomes Scythe Anastasia.</p>

                <h1 onclick="theecks('box3-2')">X</h1>
                <h1>Is Utopia even possible?<hr></h1>
                <p>A Utopia is nothing but an unrealistic dream. In order to gain something, some amount of effort is always nessacary. A Utopia implies that nobody has to do any work and go through no trouble yet still obtain major benefits. There will always be someone that you dont ssee working to make a Utopia work for the others, its impossible for a Utopia to work out for everyone, no matter how advanced technology gets. In the book Scythe, this is represented by the Scythedom. Without the Scythedom, humanity would have to fall into overpopulation, and the Thunderhead, a AI with different morals than most humans have, would not be sure of the most human way to fix the issue. If it got to the point that the thunderhead had to be in control of overpopulation, it would likely evolve into a Dystopia instead. So, the Scythes exist to do that job for the thunderhead. But with it, the scythes do not get to experience the <em>"Almost Perfect?</em> Utopia. Those who live in the Utopia, also have to live in fear of the Scythes.</p>

                <h1>Is it possible for a Utopia exist without corruption?<hr></h1>
                <p>Inevitably, no matter what you do the world will always have bad actors. People are greedy, and someone will do everything they can in order to rise to a higher power than everyone else. When they get control, they are happy, when they dont, they'll do anything to get it. There is no humane way to alter people's minds to not be greedy, without creating somewhat of a dystopia.</p>
