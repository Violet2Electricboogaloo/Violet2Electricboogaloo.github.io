        <h1>Saturday<br>Day 1 of fall break</h1>
        <p>I spent my time doing very important things such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Sleeping</p></li>
            <li><p>Sleeping</p></li>
            <li><p>Waking up</p></li>
            <li><p>Being tired</p></li>
            <li><p>Sleeping</p></li>
            <li><p>Sleeping</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was extremely time consuming and I dont know if I'd ever be able to do that again</p>
    </div>
    

        <div style="left: auto; right: 0%;">
        <h1>Sunday<br>Day 2 of fall break</h1>
        <p>I basically "locked" (I dont have a lock on my door) myself in my room and coded. I worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>My Website</p></li>
            <li><p>My Tauri Music Player Program</p></li>
            <li><p>Scrapped the Tauri Music Player Program because I am bad at Rust</p></li>
            <li><p>Started a music program in Electron</p></li>
            <li><p>Forgot about it and started working on my personal website</p></li>
            <li><p>Archived my website and started new</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I haven't ever been too proud of my website because it was much too laggy for certain people and incompatible on certain devices and deserved much better design</p>
    </div>

    <div style="bottom: 0px; top: auto; border-color: transparent; width: 100%; left:-10%">
        <div style="left: 0px; right: auto; min-height: 100%; width: 50%;">
            <h1>Monday<br>Day 3 of fall break</h1>
            <p>Continued with what iI was doing on day 2, Kept on coding my website to my hearts content!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Created my first file upload in HTML</p></li>
                <li><p>Considered very stupid ideas for making the web music player <em>entirely</em> web based</p></li>
                <li><p>Downloaded my old websites files and deleted it off of github</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Wasnt much, but it was exciting learning new things in CSS</p>
        </div>
        
    
        <div style="right: -10%; left: auto; min-height: 100%; width: 50%;">
            <h1>Tuesday<br>Day 4 of fall break</h1>
            <p>Pretty much stopped coding at this point</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Played VRChat with my Sibling</p></li>
                <li><p>Played some Risk of Rain 2 with some Quality Of Life mods</p></li>
                <li><p>Played Roblox Doors (and beat it for like the 30th time)</p></li>
                <li><p>Grabbed a 2TB External HDD and hooked it up to my computer</p></li>
                <li><p>Download over 128GiB of Wii and Gamecube Games and put it on the hard drive</p></li>
                <li><p>Stuck it in the Wii and played Wii Sports resort on my Homebrewed Wii</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course I fell asleep right after</p>
